- Items:
  - Reasoning Loop:
    - Use past user review analysis and past item review analysis to synthesize into logical reasoning steps about 
    what the review should contain and not contain
    - Can incorporate some self refinement 
  - Self Refinement:
    - Critic will look at initial review draft and make criticisms based on past reviews and analysis of user style
    - and make adjustments

    - Look at past reviews and prompt model to concisely summarize key details about user like review-writing style, 
    lifestyle preferences (e.g. are they a doctor or student?), their preferred type of item / book / restauraunt / food (task-specific),
    and other things that seem important (e.g. personality) for an accurate review 
  - Past Item Review Analysis:
    - Are there any common issues / benefits of the item that have been consistently reported across past user reviews? 
    Concisely summarize the item based on these reviews, and also base this on the task type


- Initial Agent Workflow:
  - Get analysis of past user review and past item reviews 
  - Reason loop to indicate what the review should contain until deemed (done)
    - Figure out ending condition, maybe use self reflection 
  - Create initial draft of review
  - Self refinement critique of initial draft
  - Final draft

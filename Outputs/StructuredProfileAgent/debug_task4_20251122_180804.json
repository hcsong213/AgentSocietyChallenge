Their deceptive pricing tactics, which included hidden costs and unexplained price increases, left us feeling betrayed and outraged.

One older and one younger. Then the younger guy started taking pictures of my house. I banged on the window and the guy turned Abit like he was trying to take pictures of the house where they were supposed to be. Like I hadn't literally just seen him take a picture, look at it, step closer and take another, then rotate the phone and take another picture. Inappropriate and unacceptable. You are welcome to the address you were called to and that's all.\n\nRating: 1.0 stars\nReview: Jim repaired our leaking roof, and guaranteed his work for three years. After two years, we had the same leak. We called Jim and he was extremely rude to me and my husband, and said he would not fix our roof and could no longer guarantee his work from before. We also found Jim to be unprofessional, sometimes taking weeks to return our phone calls, and promising to come look at our roof and never showing up.\n\nRating: 1.0 stars\nReview: Jim does not like to write anything down. He makes an estimate for a job verbally, and then once he's halfway into the work, he calls day after day saying more and more needs doing. The cost of some roof repairs this past summer went up by much more than his estimate. I believe he lowballs to get the work, and then ratchets the price up. \n\nThe work resulted a downspout that shot water like a fire hose right at one of our windows, causing water intrusion and damage. \n\nJim has refused 4 requests over a period of several months to send the invoice showing the work that was done and paid for, the warranty, and the materials used. At first it was because his \"office girl\" was out sick. Now he just flat out ignores the requests. \n\nHe asked for advances on payment several times because of \"cash flow problems.\"  This was a red flag, but by that time we were already in too deep with him. \n\nI cannot recommend this business whatsoever.\n\nRating: 5.0 stars\nReview: Jim was able to stop by the day I called (on a Sunday evening, no less) to assess a leak in our kitchen ceiling.  He was out the next day to repair and quickly resolved the matter.  He answered all our questions and was very helpful all around.  Hopefully this is the last of our roof issues for some time, but if not I'll be keeping Jim's card handy!\n\nCreate a comprehensive structured profile with the following schema:\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA (JSON format):\n{\n  \"item_name\": \"[name of the item/business from the item details]\",\n  \"item_type\": \"[product/restaurant/hotel/book/service/etc.]\",\n  \"common_themes\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"aspects\", \"people\", \"discuss\"],\n  \"theme_details\": {\n    \"theme1\": \"what people say about this theme\",\n    \"theme2\": \"what people say about this theme\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_distribution\": {\n    \"overall_sentiment\": \"[positive/negative/mixed]\",\n    \"average_rating\": [average],\n    \"rating_breakdown\": \"description of rating distribution\"\n  },\n  \"pros\": [\"specific\", \"positive\", \"aspects\", \"with\", \"exact\", \"vocabulary\"],\n  \"cons\": [\"specific\", \"negative\", \"aspects\", \"with\", \"exact\", \"vocabulary\"],\n  \"polarizing_aspects\": [\"things some love and others hate\"],\n  \"common_vocabulary\": [\"words\", \"and\", \"phrases\", \"that\", \"appear\", \"frequently\"],\n  \"emotional_tone\": \"[enthusiastic/disappointed/balanced/etc.]\",\n  \"specific_mentions\": [\"concrete items/features people name\"]\n}\n\nProvide ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.\n"

Katona James A Sr Roofing's shoddy workmanship resulted in persistent leaks and extensive damage to our home. Their deceptive pricing tactics, which included hidden costs and unexplained price increases, left us feeling betrayed and outraged. The unprofessional behavior exhibited by their technicians and the billing department was appalling, further frustrating and displeasing us. We strongly advise against using this service provider at all costs!\""

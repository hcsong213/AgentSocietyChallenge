Review: Visiting Philly and this place was recommended as one of the best in town. Tried it out at
lunch and it was good.
  Our problem is how they treat their customers...
 Long line out the door, but everyone was patient,until a loud mouthed guy came in and pushed his
 way to the front of the line. He then turned around to his friend  and said that their order of 15
 cheesesteaks, 15 fries and 15 sodas was put to the front of the line because he had given a $100.00
 tip to the manager. People started getting very upset after hearing this and were being very vocal.
 The loud mouth turned around and told everyone there that if they all tipped like he did they would
 all go to the front of the line too! The manager would not answer anyone's  feelings about it,
 instead hid in the back and let his young counter workers take all the 'flak'. Unbelievable! Have
 never seen, such a disregard for 'common' people who have made them successful!

Review: Paid 150 for a cake and she was a no show on 2 occasions. PayPal said this is not the first
time. Would not pay for a cake until it's in hand. This bitch is shady as hell.

Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: My experience with this place started off great but as time went on, it went downhill. I
contacted her a week before my event and she said she could do my order. Time passed, and I had a
hard time pinning her down for information and the day before my event, she ignored my call and
texts! I cancelled my order and found another bakery I could rely on! DO NOT TRUST THIS VENDOR!!!! I
wish I would have read the other reviews before I went with her. She was referred to me by a friend,
and I was so disappointed! There are many other people who are just as good and way more reliable.

Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: Paid 150 for a cake and she was a no show on 2 occasions (first she was suppose to meet me
at my place at 11 and said she was running late and would bring it at 1pm to the party). Up until
1:30 she was saying she was on her way (even at that time she couldn't be honest so we could have
enough time to run to the store and get a cake). Then she stopped answering her phone and text
message. She finally wrote a text that night probably to prevent us writing a review because as soon
as I wrote a review on Facebook she threatened that she would charge us with harassment to try and
scare us into into taking our review down. Which can't be done because our review was the truth and
we could prove it if she ever did try anything. PayPal said this is not the first time. Would not
pay for a cake until it's in hand. This business is shady as hell and if you do do business with her
I would highly recommend not paying until product is in hand.

Review: I would never order from this bakery ever again. I contacted Chelsea this morning about my
son's birthday cake for his party today. I was told by her that her assistant was on her way to her
house to pick up the cake and deliver it to me. She told me the assistant would be there in about 15
minutes and she would text me when she was on her way. I waited 45 minutes and nothing. I texted and
got no answer so I called twice and no answer. I understand things happen, but I deserved the
decency of her letting me know I would not receive my son's cake for his party. Thankfully The
Village Bakehouse came through at the last minute and made an amazing cake and smash cake for my
son's first birthday party.

Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: I know Chelle on a personal level. I'm leading all of that out. She was 3 hours late with a
wedding cake.  Says it was boxed and ready. I'll let the photos speak for themselves. Tasted
delicious at least.

Rating: 2.0 stars
Review: Actually, this is a tale of two experiences, one that would have received 5 stars and one
that barely broke the 1-star mark. I ordered cupcakes for a special event at the UA last spring and
they were absolutely sensational -- margarita and prickly pear-mango. Wowza! Sure, they were a
little pricey but they were that extra-special awesome you want for a special occasion.

So, we ordered from Mad Batter Bakery again. Turns out that was a bad idea. Chelle was an hour and a
half late delivering the order for an important lunch-time work gathering. Several people had to
leave before the cupcakes arrived and others drifted in and out in the hopes of scoring a treat at
some point. When the cupcakes finally arrived, the order wasn't even right. Chelle acknowledged the
problem but said it had been a rough day, got in her car and drove away. Very disappointing and
completely unsatisfactory. Yikes.

Bottom line: If you're okay rolling the dice on having a special dessert for a special occasion, Mad
Batter Bakery may work out for you. If, however, you need to be sure you have a perfect dessert for
your special day, well, I'd suggest you pursue more reliable bakery options. This one is too risk.

Rating: 5.0 stars
Review: I wanted something light but special for my birthday I asked  Chelle if she could make Angel
Food Cupcakes. She suggested a lemon icing. I wanted something light so she made a whipped lemon
icing. They were out of this world. I will be ordering them again this year. She delivered them to
me on my Birthday.

Rating: 5.0 stars
Review: i've used her for many birthday cakes over the last few years and they have all been really
tasty, exceeded our expectations, and her customer service is wonderful!  and she'll even deliver
:-)  definitely give her a try next time you need a fun cake - the chocolate peanut butter one she
made for my brother people are still raving about!

Rating: 5.0 stars
Review: For my daughter's birthday, I ordered 2 dozen mini cheesecakes (chocolate covered strawberry
and blueberry) to have delivered to her. She is a student at U of A. I am in the Bay Area, Ca.
Chelle  was professional, informative, and prompt.  We handled the order and details directly over
the phone and conveniently over text.  Chelle, went out of her way to accommodate my daughter's
specific tastes.  She also hand delivered to my daughter on her birthday. My daughter doesn't like
icing or heavily iced cakes or cupcakes.  She loves cheesecake but is particular to home made with
fresh fruit topping.  This is why Mad Batter Bakery was the perfect choice because Chelle's menu
incorporates fresh fruit on some selections including cheesecakes and minis.  Thanks to Chelle's
help, I was able to pull off surprising my daughter on her birthday, all the way from home. My
daughter absolutely loved the mini cheesecakes.  She commented on the perfect portion size, texture,
sweetness level and most importantly the fresh chocolate covered strawberries on each cheesecake.

I highly recommend Mad Batter bakery for the cheesecake minis and for the great, personal service!

Rating: 5.0 stars
Review: Mad Batter Bakery was easy to work with, prompt with responses and, most importantly, the
cupcakes we ordered for our daughter's first birthday were delicious and beautiful!  We will only
order from here from now on!

Rating: 5.0 stars
Review: I live out of state and was able to have surprise cupcakes delivered for my nephew's
birthday thanks to Mad Batter Bakery. I received a prompt response via email, and ordering was easy.
My family said the cupcakes were delicious and thoroughly enjoyed by all the kids!

Review: Visiting Philly and this place was recommended as one of the best in town. Tried it out at

  Our problem is how they treat their customers...
 Long line out the door, but everyone was patient,until a loud mouthed guy came in and pushed his

 cheesesteaks, 15 fries and 15 sodas was put to the front of the line because he had given a $100.00

 The loud mouth turned around and told everyone there that if they all tipped like he did they would
 all go to the front of the line too! The manager would not answer anyone's  feelings about it,
 instead hid in the back and let his young counter workers take all the 'flak'. Unbelievable! Have
 never seen, such a disregard for 'common' people who have made them successful!

SIMILAR ITEM REVIEW (semantic/emotional reference):
 Not a fan of this bakery as it lacks professionalism and courtesy. I ordered 2 dozen cupcakes for
 an event and it took several calls and texts to finally get some sort of confirmation. We agreed on
 a time for delivery and when she was about 5 minutes late I contacted the company and was told she
 was "running behind" and still needed to get gas. How professional is it to set up a time for
 delivery only to not plan appropriately for the basic needs of the delivery (ie have enough gas to
 get there?) And not bother to call or contact the customer to tell them you are late. So she
 finally showed up and I barely got an apology. Was I frustrated and probably a little dismissive?
 Yes. Was I also late to an event at a venue that I paid several hundred dollars for because of the
 owners lack of communication and professionalism? Yes. While the cupcakes were good, I ordered
 cupcakes from a different local bakery for something else and realized how small this bakery's
 cupcakes are. And expensive for the size. Will not go back. *i will agree with another review that
 the Facebook page had several bad reviews and the owner shut down reviews so they can't be seen
 now. Weird right?!*

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. FOLLOW THE ALIGNMENT PLAN:
   - Use the predicted rating
   - Mention the key aspects specified
   - Use the specific vocabulary and concrete details listed
   - Apply the emotional angle described
   - Follow all style directives (tone, length, punctuation, structure)

2. MIMIC THE USER'S AUTHENTIC VOICE:
   - Study the example reviews carefully
   - Copy their exact vocabulary level and sentence patterns
   - Match their grammar style (fragments vs. complete sentences)
   - Use their punctuation patterns (exclamations, ellipses, etc.)
   - Mirror their emotional expression style
   - Match their typical review length

3. ENSURE SEMANTIC/TOPIC ALIGNMENT:
   - Include the concrete details from the alignment plan
   - Use vocabulary that appears in the item profile
   - Echo phrases from the similar item review when appropriate
   - Be specific about this business, not generic

Think of it as: The ALIGNMENT PLAN tells you WHAT to say, the USER PROFILE tells you HOW to say it,
and the EXAMPLES show you the user's authentic voice to copy.

stars: 1.0

review: Oh, Mad Batter Bakery... what a disappointment! I had high hopes for their famous treats but
it seems professionalism and courtesy are as scarce as their large cupcakes (and expensive for the
size)! I reserved a cake for pickup, agreed on a time, only to be ghosted by them! No response to my
calls or messages... just *crickets*. And when they finally did arrive, it was like pulling teeth
trying to get an apology out of them.

The service at Mad Batter Bakery is nothing short of disastrous. I waited for an hour past my
reservation time and no one seemed to care. No acknowledgement, no empathy, just pure disregard for
their customers who keep them in business. It's a shame that such a successful bakery can treat its
patrons like this, acting like the common people who support them every day don't matter.

And let's not forget about delivery! I ordered a cake to be delivered, but it never arrived! Not
even a call or text to explain what happened. Unbelievable! This bakery lacks basic communication
skills, making customers feel unimportant and frustrated. It's no wonder their Facebook page has
several bad reviews and the owner shut down reviews so they can't be seen now. Weird right?!

Sadly, I will not be going back to Mad Batter Bakery. Their lack of professionalism and courtesy
simply cannot be overlooked, even if their treats are tasty. There are plenty of other bakeries in
town that treat their customers with respect and provide excellent service. Until then, good
riddance to this so-called "successful" bakery!

USER'S PAST REVIEW EXAMPLES:
Example 1:
Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: Visiting Philly and this place was recommended as one of the best in town. Tried it out at
lunch and it was good.
  Our problem is how they treat their customers...
 Long line out the door, but everyone was patient,until a loud mouthed guy came in and pushed his
 way to the front of the line. He then turned around to his friend  and said that their order of 15
 cheesesteaks, 15 fries and 15 sodas was put to the front of the line because he had given a $100.00
 tip to the manager. People started getting very upset after hearing this and were being very vocal.
 The loud mouth turned around and told everyone there that if they all tipped like he did they would
 all go to the front of the line too! The manager would not answer anyone's  feelings about it,
 instead hid in the back and let his young counter workers take all the 'flak'. Unbelievable! Have
 never seen, such a disregard for 'common' people who have made them successful!

ITEM'S PAST REVIEW EXAMPLES:
Example 1:
Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: Paid 150 for a cake and she was a no show on 2 occasions. PayPal said this is not the first
time. Would not pay for a cake until it's in hand. This bitch is shady as hell.

Example 2:
Rating: 2.0 stars
Review: Actually, this is a tale of two experiences, one that would have received 5 stars and one
that barely broke the 1-star mark. I ordered cupcakes for a special event at the UA last spring and
they were absolutely sensational -- margarita and prickly pear-mango. Wowza! Sure, they were a
little pricey but they were that extra-special awesome you want for a special occasion.

So, we ordered from Mad Batter Bakery again. Turns out that was a bad idea. Chelle was an hour and a
half late delivering the order for an important lunch-time work gathering. Several people had to
leave before the cupcakes arrived and others drifted in and out in the hopes of scoring a treat at
some point. When the cupcakes finally arrived, the order wasn't even right. Chelle acknowledged the
problem but said it had been a rough day, got in her car and drove away. Very disappointing and
completely unsatisfactory. Yikes.

Bottom line: If you're okay rolling the dice on having a special dessert for a special occasion, Mad
Batter Bakery may work out for you. If, however, you need to be sure you have a perfect dessert for
your special day, well, I'd suggest you pursue more reliable bakery options. This one is too risk.

Example 3:
Rating: 5.0 stars
Review: I wanted something light but special for my birthday I asked  Chelle if she could make Angel
Food Cupcakes. She suggested a lemon icing. I wanted something light so she made a whipped lemon
icing. They were out of this world. I will be ordering them again this year. She delivered them to
me on my Birthday.

SIMILAR ITEM REVIEW:
 Not a fan of this bakery as it lacks professionalism and courtesy. I ordered 2 dozen cupcakes for
 an event and it took several calls and texts to finally get some sort of confirmation. We agreed on
 a time for delivery and when she was about 5 minutes late I contacted the company and was told she
 was "running behind" and still needed to get gas. How professional is it to set up a time for
 delivery only to not plan appropriately for the basic needs of the delivery (ie have enough gas to
 get there?) And not bother to call or contact the customer to tell them you are late. So she
 finally showed up and I barely got an apology. Was I frustrated and probably a little dismissive?
 Yes. Was I also late to an event at a venue that I paid several hundred dollars for because of the
 owners lack of communication and professionalism? Yes. While the cupcakes were good, I ordered
 cupcakes from a different local bakery for something else and realized how small this bakery's
 cupcakes are. And expensive for the size. Will not go back. *i will agree with another review that
 the Facebook page had several bad reviews and the owner shut down reviews so they can't be seen
 now. Weird right?!*

RESPONSE:

Critique: The generated review matches the user's vocabulary level and sentence structure, but there
is a deviation in punctuation patterns as compared to the user profile. Additionally, emotional
expression is dramatic which aligns with the sentiment tendency provided in the user profile.
However, it would be beneficial to expand on specific details of the service quality and food
quality mentioned in the focus aspects section of the user profile.

Refined Review: Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: Mad Batter Bakery left me disappointed after a less-than-professional experience. I had
reserved a cake for pickup, agreed on a time, but found no response to my calls or messages. The
service was not only unreliable, but the staff seemed unapologetic when they finally did arrive.
Their cupcakes, while tasty, were expensive and small in size, making the poor service quality even
more frustrating. This incident has left a lasting impression of disregard for customers' time and
experiences.

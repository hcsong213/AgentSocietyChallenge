[USER]
Generate THREE distinct review drafts for this user-item pair.

CONTEXT:
User examples:
Example 1:
Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: Terrible customer service. The technicians cannot solve problems, and the billing department
is rude and unresponsive.  Don't ask to talk to supervisor because they don't want to transfer you.
Don't complain about getting calls that are dial toned because they can't deal with it. They expect
that going on the Do Not Call list will work. Disgusting And expensive.

Item examples:
Example 1:
Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: Mr.Katona is currently in legal proceedings because of the damage he is caused at our home.

As the other reviewers reported, he tells you one price, accepts a down payment, then increases the
price by 40% the day he begins work.

Refused to put anything in writing, and was barely responsive even during our law suit. 

I don't believe anyone should be forced to go through a nightmare like this company.

Example 2:
Rating: 5.0 stars
Review: Jim was able to stop by the day I called (on a Sunday evening, no less) to assess a leak in
our kitchen ceiling.  He was out the next day to repair and quickly resolved the matter.  He
answered all our questions and was very helpful all around.  Hopefully this is the last of our roof
issues for some time, but if not I'll be keeping Jim's card handy!

LLM CALL #2
====================================================================================================

REQUEST:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: Concise
stars: 1.0
review: Avoid Mr. Katona Roofing at all costs. Terrible customer service, unprofessional behavior,
and significant price increases after accepting a down payment.

Type: Analytical
stars: 2.0
review: I gave Mr. Katona Roofing a second chance despite the negative reviews, but my experience
was even worse than expected. The company refuses to put anything in writing and increased the price
by 40% after accepting a down payment. Their lack of transparency and unprofessionalism make them
undeserving of any business.

Type: Emotional
stars: 1.0
review: Oh boy, where do I begin? Mr. Katona Roofing caused us nothing but trouble and stress. They
tell you one price, accept your down payment, then raise it 40% the day they start working. We were
even forced to go through a lawsuit with them due to their unprofessional behavior, and even during
that time, they barely communicated. I hope no one has to experience a nightmare like this company
ever again!

LLM CALL #4
====================================================================================================

REQUEST:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Critiques:
- Draft 1: This draft provides a concise review, but it lacks some of the emotional impact and
detailed issues present in the other drafts.
- Draft 2: This draft is analytical and highlights important problems with the business, but it
could benefit from more emotionally charged language to reflect the user's frustration.
- Draft 3: This draft captures the user's emotion well, but it may be slightly overdramatic and
could benefit from being more concise and focusing on the most significant issues.

Final:
stars: 1.0
review: Oh boy, where do I begin? Mr. Katona Roofing caused us nothing but trouble and stress. They
tell you one price, accept your down payment, then raise it 40% the day they start working. We were

If the review already matches the user's voice closely, return it unchanged. Otherwise, produce a
revised review that keeps the same rating but better matches tone, vocabulary, and length of the
user examples.

Refined Review:
Rating: 1.0 stars
Review: Oh boy, Mr. Katona Roofing is nothing short of a disaster! They promise one price, take your
payment, then bump it up by 40% the minute they start working. We had to go through the stress and
hassle of a lawsuit with them because of their shoddy work and unprofessional behavior, and even
during that time, communication was next to nothing. I sincerely hope no one has to suffer through
this kind of nightmare with a company like this!
